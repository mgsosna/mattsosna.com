My name is Matt. I'm a data scientist passionate about sustainability and data-driven decision-making. I work at [Aquicore](https://www.aquicore.com), where I help optimize energy usage for buildings to cut costs and carbon emissions. I'm a 2019 alum of the [Clean Energy Leadership Institute](https://cleanenergyleaders.org) fellowship, where I worked to bring a data science perspective to discussions on how to decarbonize our economy and mitigate the worst effects of climate change.

Previously I was a machine learning engineer at [SoKat](https://sokat.co), where my main goal was to use machine learning to help grantors at the Department of Health and Human Services decide how to allocate federal funding. Prior to SoKat, I obtained a Ph.D. at Princeton, where my thesis examined how simple behaviors scale to complex emergent group properties. Before Princeton, I was a Fulbright scholar at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany. You can see the results of my academic efforts at the [Academics]({{ site.baseurl }}/academics/) page.

Effective communication and promoting technical literacy are two of my highest priorities, and I work to regularly publish posts on how to better visualize and understand topics in statistics and programming. Check the [Blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/) page for posts about programming, as well as advice for academics.

Finally, success in a career is never independent, and I've been very lucky throughout my life to have the help of many people. I am always willing to try to help you succeed in what makes you happy, as many others have done the same for me (often before I even understood that I should be thanking them). As such, I will always do my best to answer any questions about academia that this blog might attract.

## Quick questions
**Sosna? Grobis?** <br>
I got married in 2018. My wife and I decided to choose a new surname, Sosna, that reflected both our respective roots: California and Poland.

**Why data science?** <br>
Because data science rocks!
