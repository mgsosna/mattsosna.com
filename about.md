My name is Matt. I'm a data scientist passionate about data-driven decisions and sustainability. I work as a machine learning engineer at [SoKat Consulting](https://sokat.co), where my main goal is to use machine learning to help grantors at the Department of Health and Human Services decide how to allocate federal funding. I am also a 2019 Fellow at the [Clean Energy Leadership Institute](https://cleanenergyleaders.org), where I work to bring a data science perspective to discussions on how to decarbonize our economy and mitigate the worst effects of climate change.

Prior to SoKat, I obtained a Ph.D. at Princeton, where my thesis examined how simple behaviors scale to complex emergent group properties. I combined lab experiments on fish schools with simulations and modeling to investigate how rapid information transfer allows fish to avoid predation. Before Princeton, I was a Fulbright scholar at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany. You can see the results of these efforts at the [Academics](https://mgsosna.github.io/academics/) page.

Effective communication and promoting technical literacy are two of my highest priorities, and I work to regularly publish posts on how to better visualize and understand topics in statistics and programming. Check the [Blog](https://mgsosna.github.io/blog/) page for posts about programming, as well as advice for academics.

Finally, success in a career is never independent, and I've been very lucky throughout my life to have the help of many people. I am always willing to try to help you succeed in what makes you happy, as many others have done the same for me (often before I even understood that I should be thanking them). As such, I will always do my best to answer any questions about academia that this blog might attract.
