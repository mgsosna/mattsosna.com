My name is Matt. I'm an academic turned data scientist passionate about sustainability and data-driven decision-making. A brief summary of my CV is [below](#quick-timeline), or you can get more detail at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-sosna-ph-d-b2a18b34/) profile.

**My goal with this site is to make it easier to understand programming, statistics, and science.** For much of my life, I thought computer science and math just "weren't my thing", despite how interested I was in those topics. It took being forced to code extensively during my Ph.D. to overcome the initial intimidation and realize that these topics _are_ accessible with a little patience. Hopefully this blog lowers the barrier of entry to others.

The [landing page]({{ site.baseurl }}/) of this site is the blog posts in chronological order. The posts are organized by topic on the [Blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/) page, where you can find posts with academic advice for students, tips and tricks for Python and R, explorations of statistical concepts, and more. For those of you interested in a deep dive into animal behavior research, the [Academics]({{ site.baseurl }}/academics/) page has links to publications from my academic life.

Success in a career is never independent, and I've been fortunate throughout my life to have the help of many people. I am always willing to try to help you succeed in what makes you happy, as many others have done the same for me (often before I even understood that I should be thanking them). As such, I will always do my best to answer any questions this blog might attract. You can reach me at <span style = "color:darkorange">[my first name].[g].[my last name]@gmail.com.</span>
