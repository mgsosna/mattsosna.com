No matter how technically skilled you are in statistics and programming, you're not that effective if you're chasing answers to questions that don't help the business. Similarly, getting people to actually adopt the results of your analyses will require significant interpersonal skills. This post will outline the _**business**_ and _**personal**_ skills needed to be successful as a data scientist.

2. [The statistics]({{  site.baseurl  }}/DS-transition-2)
3. [The programming]({{  site.baseurl  }}/DS-transition-3)
4. [The engineering]({{  site.baseurl  }}/DS-transition-4)
5. **The people**

## Non-machine learning
The last three posts were a deep dive on some technical skills for data science: [statistics]({{  site.baseurl  }}/DS-transition-2), [analytics]({{  site.baseurl  }}/DS-transition-3), and [software engineering]({{  site.baseurl  }}/DS-transition-4). With these under the belt, you should have a solid starting point for many data science roles.

But in this post, we'll instead ask **what** tasks to focus on and **why**? What are the questions that actually help a business move forward?

* Need to focus on what the business needs are
 - e.g. customers feel like they're not getting enough value from your product. So you need to make that value more visible. e.g. Can you quantify the benefits, such as savings, or increased revenue for them, relative to the cost of your product? Can you do this in a way that controls for external factors like seasonality (e.g. more people buy stuff in November/December)?

## Business skills: knowing *what* to do and *why*
A word to the wise, though... programming skills are often easier to pick up than domain knowledge. There are dozens of resources out there for learning coding. Not so many for getting hands-on experience with Building Automation Systems, or legal documentation, or whatever. Think about what you would need a professional to teach you vs. what you can learn on your own.

Now let's say you've identified where on the analytics-engineering spectrum you fall and what level of computational complexity you're comfortable with. (Maybe better: identify what field or big-picture challenge you want to work on, and then see what the people in that field need.)

* **Business**
- [ ] Strong ability to explain technical concepts
- [ ] Focus on how to best deliver business value <br><br>


Some thoughts:
* Speed-accuracy tradeoff. **You need to operate with constraints in mind.** You likely don't have the time to deliver a perfect analysis. Diminishing returns.

### Explainability
Should this fall under personal skills? I guess it's a business skill.

### Company focus

## Personal skills: knowing how to *consistently deliver*
For it to be impactful, it needs to be relevant. There's a philosophy/lifestyle for successful people in tech: you need to constantly be learning. There's a sort of humility in knowing that the in-demand tools of the day will keep changing. It's like resting on a slowly-moving treadmill... stop moving and you'll gradually slip away.

* You need to love programming. For most of your day, for most of your days, you're going to be reading and writing code.
* You need to love learning. There is a staggering amount to programming languages and frameworks out there. There's also a huge number of ways to get a job done, ranging from barely getting the job done to being computationally optimized and able to handle any attempt at forcing an error. Like the Red Queen in *Alice and Wonderland*, you can't stay still - you need to always be learning. (Or you'll eventually end up only able to write code in increasingly esoteric situations, like Maryland's recent call for COBOL programmers...)

* Need to constantly be learning and improving
* New technologies and frameworks will come, and you'll need to learn them to stay relevant.

## Concluding thoughts
This series has covered a lot. We started by talking about [how to navigate the diversity of data science roles]({{  site.baseurl  }}/DS-transition-1) before going into detail on some useful technical skills: [statistics]({{  site.baseurl  }}/DS-transition-2), [analytics]({{  site.baseurl  }}/DS-transition-3), and [software engineering]({{  site.baseurl  }}/DS-transition-4). The last three posts covered **how** to accomplish a task as a data scientist.
