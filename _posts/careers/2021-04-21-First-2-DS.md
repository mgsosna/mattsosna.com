Data science in startups is notorious for being a memorable ride. From work that pivots on a dime from spreadsheets to customer interviews to CICD pipelines, to being handed more responsibility than you likely know what to do with, you're guaranteed to learn nonstop in this role.

But what about being the *first* data scientist at a startup, the tip of the spear? Or what if you're the second to join, the extra manpower for those more ambitious projects?

To answer these questions, I spoke with my great friend and colleague, [Minkyung Kang (MK)](https://mkang32.github.io/), who founded the data science team at our company Aquicore. As the second data scientist, I was interested to see where our experiences aligned versus diverged. Together, we identified three main lessons for anyone considering joining a startup as the first or second data scientist.

### Question \#1: What data does the company have?

### Question \#2: What is your expected deliverable?
Matt: Are you writing spreadsheets or building models? Your experience will vary greatly depending on where in the [analytics-engineering spectrum]({{ site.baseurl }}/DS-transition-1) your role falls.

Data science is a broad field, and specializing on a subset like NLP or time series data is often a luxury restricted to data scientists at larger companies.

In SaaS companies in particular, your model will usually need to be incorporated into the product somehow - who will do that?

### Question \#3: Are you a data evangelist?
