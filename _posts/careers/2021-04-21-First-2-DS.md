Data science in startups is notorious for being a memorable ride. From work that pivots on a dime from spreadsheets to customer interviews to CICD pipelines, to being handed more responsibility than you likely know what to do with, you're guaranteed to learn nonstop in this role.

But what about being the *first* data scientist at a startup, the tip of the spear? Or what if you're the second to join, the extra manpower for those more ambitious projects?

To answer these questions, I spoke with my great friend and colleague, [Minkyung Kang (MK)](https://mkang32.github.io/), who founded the data science team at our company Aquicore. As the second data scientist, I was interested to see where our experiences aligned versus diverged. Together, we identified three defining summaries of our experience, as well as three questions to ask yourself if you’re considering joining a startup as one of the first data scientists.

## The experience
### 1. Constant trial and error, constant learning
Startups invariably have fewer resources than mature companies. This means that while data science spans a broad [analytics-engineering spectrum](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-analytics-engineering-spectrum-of-data-science-jobs-3cf05c5f2d0b) comprising [several more specific occupations](https://towardsdatascience.com/which-flavor-of-data-professional-are-you-5e01375584ce), all work even remotely related to data science will come to you simply because you're the only "data person" around.

This can either be incredibly annoying or incredibly empowering depending on your perspective. Because there might not be a dedicated product manager coordinating your roadmap, you can sharpen your [business skills](https://towardsdatascience.com/business-and-personal-skills-to-supercharge-your-impact-22fbd43e32e9) by working directly with stakeholders to define the user experience. Since the other software engineers are busy, you can be the one who sets up the database, containerizes the model, and deploys it.

By being involved in every step of a project $-$ from ideas scribbled on a whiteboard to releasing your model to production $-$ you gain a holistic picture of the business and the role data science can play. **This end-to-end lifecycle means you can become a full-stack data scientist, a coveted “unicorn.”**

But this learning doesn’t come easily. Unless you’re joining the company with years of experience under your belt, **you will constantly face questions you don’t know the answers to.** Is a [SQL or NoSQL database](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-hands-on-demo-of-sql-vs-nosql-databases-in-python-eeb955bba4aa) the right storage for a new data source? What do I do if I build a dashboard that internal teams end up not using? Do customers care more about false negatives or false positives when being alerted about potential anomalies?

For the business or software engineering questions, you can hopefully find mentors in the company to help you figure out the answers. But when it comes to core data science questions, like identifying the right features for a model or how to deal with biased training data $-$ if you're the first data scientist, you're on your own! And even if you're the second data scientist, it can be hard for the two of you to identify the scalable, best-practice way to build a product without a mentor who's "been there" before.

**The result is a lot of trial and error.** It will be humbling constantly facing how much you _don't_ know as you take on a never-ending flow of fresh challenges. But if you're willing to learn from your mistakes, you'll quickly grow as an analyst, engineer, and critical thinker.

### 2. Developing business acumen over deep technical expertise
One of the greatest things about being an early data scientist in a startup is being so close to the core of the business. You never work on a task "just because" $-$ there is always a pressing business context, a clearly defined need for you to address. 

Data scientists in large companies are often given tasks without much business context, or not being able to influence that context at all. If you're an early DS, you will work closely with the business to understand the context and likely even influence it.

Being able to explain a concept to others in the company so they trust it = essential. But this can bias towards simpler methods - since you need to convince non-technical stakeholders about your work, you might end up not developing as deep an understanding on more complex methods.


## Questions
Do the above lessons align with what you want?


(I still wonder if "lessons" is the right way to describe the section above. They're more like questions for yourself, and the next part is questions about the business.)


### 1. What is the company's vision for the role?
What is the company trying to achieve with data science?


### Question \#2: What is your expected deliverable?
Matt: Are you writing spreadsheets or building models? Your experience will vary greatly depending on where in the [analytics-engineering spectrum]({{ site.baseurl }}/DS-transition-1) your role falls.

Data science is a broad field, and specializing on a subset like NLP or time series data is often a luxury restricted to data scientists at larger companies.

In SaaS companies in particular, your model will usually need to be incorporated into the product somehow - who will do that?

### Question \#3: Are you a data evangelist?
