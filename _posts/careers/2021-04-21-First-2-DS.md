Data science in startups is notorious for being a memorable ride. From work that pivots on a dime from spreadsheets to customer interviews to CICD pipelines, to being handed more responsibility than you likely know what to do with, you're guaranteed to learn nonstop in this role.

But what about being the *first* data scientist at a startup, the tip of the spear? Or what if you're the second to join, the extra manpower for those more ambitious projects?

To answer these questions, I spoke with my great friend and colleague, [Minkyung Kang (MK)](https://mkang32.github.io/), who founded the data science team at our company Aquicore. As the second data scientist, I was interested to see where our experiences aligned versus diverged. Together, we identified three main lessons for anyone considering joining a startup as the first or second data scientist.
