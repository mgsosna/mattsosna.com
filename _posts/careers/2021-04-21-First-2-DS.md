Data science in startups is notorious for being a memorable ride. From work that pivots on a dime from spreadsheets to customer interviews to CICD pipelines, to being handed more responsibility than you likely know what to do with, you're guaranteed to learn nonstop in this role.

But what about being the *first* data scientist at a startup, the tip of the spear? Or what if you're the second to join, the extra manpower for those more ambitious projects?

To answer these questions, I spoke with my great friend and colleague, [Minkyung Kang (MK)](https://mkang32.github.io/), who founded the data science team at our company Aquicore. As the second data scientist, I was interested to see where our experiences aligned versus diverged. Together, we identified three key summaries of our experiences, as well as three questions to ask yourself if you’re considering joining a startup as one of the first data scientists.

## The experience
### 1. Constant trial and error, constant learning
Startups invariably have fewer resources than mature companies. This means that while data science spans a broad [analytics-engineering spectrum](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-analytics-engineering-spectrum-of-data-science-jobs-3cf05c5f2d0b) comprising [several more specific occupations](https://towardsdatascience.com/which-flavor-of-data-professional-are-you-5e01375584ce), all work even remotely related to data science will come to you simply because you're the only "data person" around.

This can either be incredibly annoying or incredibly empowering depending on your perspective. Because there might not be a dedicated product manager coordinating your roadmap, you can sharpen your [business skills](https://towardsdatascience.com/business-and-personal-skills-to-supercharge-your-impact-22fbd43e32e9) by working directly with stakeholders to define the user experience. Since the other software engineers are busy, you can be the one who sets up the database, containerizes the model, and deploys it.

By being involved in every step of a project $-$ from ideas scribbled on a whiteboard to releasing your model to production $-$ you gain a holistic picture of the business and the role data science can play. **This end-to-end lifecycle means you can become a full-stack data scientist, a coveted “unicorn.”**

But this learning doesn’t come easily. Unless you’re joining the company with years of experience under your belt, **you will constantly face questions you don’t know the answers to.** Is a [SQL or NoSQL database](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-hands-on-demo-of-sql-vs-nosql-databases-in-python-eeb955bba4aa) the right storage for a new data source? What do I do if I build a dashboard that internal teams end up not using? Do customers care more about false negatives or false positives when being alerted about potential anomalies?

For the business or software engineering questions, you can hopefully find mentors in the company to help you figure out the answers. But when it comes to core data science questions, like identifying the right features for a model or how to deal with biased training data $-$ if you're the first data scientist, you're on your own! And even if you're the second data scientist, it can be hard for the two of you to identify the scalable, best-practice way to build a product without a mentor who's "been there" before.

**The result is a lot of trial and error.** It will be humbling constantly facing how much you _don't_ know as you take on a never-ending flow of fresh challenges. But if you're willing to learn from your mistakes, you'll quickly grow as an analyst, engineer, and critical thinker.

### 2. Develop more business acumen than technical expertise
One of the best things about being an early data scientist in a startup is working closely with senior leadership. You never work on a task "just because" $-$ there is always a pressing business context, a clearly defined need for you to address. By meeting regularly with the CEO, or head of Product, or VP of Sales, you begin to understand the broader ecosystem your company exists in.

The result is that **you develop a strong understanding of how to do _impactful_ data science.** You never have to wonder if the model or dashboard you build is actually useful $-$ your stakeholders are probably sitting at the desk next to you! If your output misses the mark, you will immediately know why. As you iterate on their feedback, you inevitably develop a *solutions-focused* rather than *technology-focused* approach. You start thinking in terms of _**"What's needed to solve this problem?"**_ rather than _**"What can I do with this tool?"**_

But while you're building a strong business sense, you're likely _not_ developing deep expertise in any data science domain. Unless your company's core market offering is image recognition, you're not going to become an expert in computer vision. Unless your company's product is a text summarizer, don't expect to significantly grow your NLP skills. While this is arguably the case in most small or mid-sized companies, it's especially true in startups; the business needs simply change too quickly.

Rather than becoming a time series expert, you're more likely to become an expert in _**communicating to non-technical stakeholders.**_ And rather than learning the latest cutting-edge analytics tool, you're likely to become an expert in _**statistics fundamentals**_ as you repeatedly explain how your model arrives at its conclusions.

The story differs a little, however, for software engineering skills. You _will_ learn a wide range of technical skills needed to get your model across the finish line, its outputs displayed in an internal dashboard or integrated into your company's software. You _will_ become comfortable with the command line as you deploy Flask APIs, use servers in the cloud, and set up a daily pipeline in [Databricks](https://databricks.com/) or [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/). **But this knowledge will likely be patchy:** you'll know enough for your use case, but not necessarily enough to help others with theirs.

### 3. Grow as a manager rather than individual contributor
If you're regularly involved with business discussions and coordinating work with other teams, you'll naturally learn more about how to ask the right questions and identify the solution. While you'll still carry out the technical execution of that solution when you're an earlier member, you may find yourself naturally falling into a more managerial role rather than individual contributor when it comes time to grow the team. From your company's perspective, having a solid understanding of the business and the role data science can play is harder to acquire than the technical skills to carry out ideas.

This doesn't mean you can't be an IC, or this will stop you from becoming one in the future. But it may need to be a more conscious effort on your part to stay deep in the tech stack if that's your priority.





## Questions
Do the above lessons align with what you want?




### 1. What is the company's vision for the role?
What is the company trying to achieve with data science?

Are you writing spreadsheets or building models? Your experience will vary greatly depending on where in the [analytics-engineering spectrum]({{ site.baseurl }}/DS-transition-1) your role falls.

Data science is a broad field, and specializing on a subset like NLP or time series data is often a luxury restricted to data scientists at larger companies.

In SaaS companies in particular, your model will usually need to be incorporated into the product somehow - who will do that?



### 2. Is the data ready?

### 3. Is there a data science "champion"?

## Conclusions
You'll learn a lot of business skills in startups but not necessarily do a deep dive in any particular technical domain (unless that's part of your core offering). But this is likely the way at any company, unless maybe data science consulting (where the business needs are likely already defined before you arrive, and you might be able to hand off building the engineering architecture).

All of these things are just things you'll need to learn on your own if you want.
