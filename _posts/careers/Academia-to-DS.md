**"I could always do data science if academia doesn't work out."** It's a recurring thought many graduate students and postdocs experience, especially if their work involves hearty servings of coding and statistics, the core elements of data science. Academics *are* highly sought-after for data science positions: if you're surviving the challenges of independent research, then you undoubtedly have the ability to _**distill interesting questions from large amounts of information**_, as well as _**the focus and analytical chops**_ to answer those questions.

But what necessary technical skills are you *not* picking up in your daily academic work? And perhaps more importantly, what *non-technical* skills are required to succeed in industry? This post will outline the hard and soft skills that will make you even more attractive as a candidate when applying to data science positions.

## Where do I begin?
As a primer, read these posts:
* [How to enter data science I - identify the target]({{ site.baseurl }}/DS-transition-1)
* [How to enter data science II - build the skillset]({{ site.baseurl }}/DS-transition-2)

The first post tries to instill some order on the huge range of occupations falling under the title "data scientist." The main points are two spectra: 1) analytics-engineering, and 2) computational complexity.

## A shift in perspective
Regardless of where you're aiming on the data science spectrum, it's critical to have **the right mentality**. When you're doing projects on your own, you can find that you're really good at whatever you put your mind to. That's great. But more importantly, you need to think of it this way:

 **There's a shift in how you view yourself as a coder** that's required for you to succeed in industry:

> **What you might be thinking:** <br>"I can code anything I want." <br><br>
> **What industry wants:** <br>"I can code anything someone asks me."

Especially in open-ended Ph.D. programs in the U.S., you have the flexibility to choose the research questions you pursue, as well as how you go about answering those questions. This makes it easy to gravitate towards questions and methods you're comfortable with and get _really good_ at a narrow set of skills. In a way, that's what a Ph.D. is all about: you choose a very precise question to answer, and you work until you know more about this sliver of knowledge than anyone else in the world.

You don't have the luxury of a narrow skill set when you're a data scientist, *especially* if you're at a smaller company. There's a term called ["full-stack"](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp) in software engineering - it refers to programmers who can code professionally in both the front-end and back-end environments, which require entirely different languages, perspectives, and skill sets. Data science is like being a full-stack engineer: you need to be comfortable rotating between different skill sets. It's a generalist position between data analyst and data engineer.

I found it so easy to stay in the areas of R and statistics that I already knew well. I didn't want to get out of my comfort zone, because it would require me to face the scary concept that I _don't_ actually have that wide a grasp on stats and coding. And especially with a Ph.D., there are a lot of expectations on how much you're "supposed to" know or how smart you're supposed to be. But you need to remember that the Ph.D. is a very deep, narrow knowledge set, versus the broad knowledge needed for being a versatile data scientist.

**Versatility** is key.

"10 decimal places" accuracy versus operating within constraints. Check out the [business skills]({{  site.baseurl  }}/DS-transition-5) in the [transitioning into data science series]({{  site.baseurl  }}/blog/#how-to-transition-into-data-science) for more on this.
