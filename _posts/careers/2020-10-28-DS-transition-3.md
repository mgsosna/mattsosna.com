No matter how technically skilled you are in statistics and programming, you're not that effective if you're chasing answers to questions that don't help the business. Similarly, getting people to actually adopt the results of your analyses will require significant interpersonal skills. This post will outline the _**business**_ and _**personal**_ skills needed to be successful as a data scientist.

## Business skills: knowing *what* to do and *why*
A word to the wise, though... programming skills are often easier to pick up than domain knowledge. There are dozens of resources out there for learning coding. Not so many for getting hands-on experience with Building Automation Systems, or legal documentation, or whatever. Think about what you would need a professional to teach you vs. what you can learn on your own.

Now let's say you've identified where on the analytics-engineering spectrum you fall and what level of computational complexity you're comfortable with. (Maybe better: identify what field or big-picture challenge you want to work on, and then see what the people in that field need.)

* **Business**
- [ ] Strong ability to explain technical concepts
- [ ] Focus on how to best deliver business value <br><br>


### Explainability
Should this fall under personal skills? I guess it's a business skill.

### Company focus
