**"I could always do data science if academia doesn't work out."** It's a recurring thought many graduate students and postdocs experience, especially if their work involves hearty servings of [programming]({{  site.baseurl  }}/DS-transition-3) and [statistics]({{  site.baseurl  }}/DS-transition-2), the core elements of data science. Academics *do* have many qualities that make them attractive candidates for data science positions, but there are also large holes in their skillsets that will prevent them from being hired straight off the bat.

This post will outline the skills needed to make the leap from the ivory tower to industry. We'll go light on the technical details or business acumen; for a deep dive on those skills, check out my five-part [how to enter data science series]({{  site.baseurl  }}/DS-transition-1). Especially if you're just starting to consider data science as a career, I highly recommend thinking about where your ideal role falls on the [analytics-engineering spectrum]({{  site.baseurl  }}/DS-transition-1/#the-scalpel-versus-the-shovel), which will help you identify which skills to prioritize learning.

## What are we working with?
### Where academics excel
If you're surviving the challenges of independent research, then you undoubtedly have:
1. The ability to distill interesting questions from large amounts of information
2. The analytical chops to answer those questions
3. Extreme attention to detail
4. Strong planning and organization
5. Serious mental fortitude to push through constant failure

Successful research involves dozens of moving pieces; to collect data for my final thesis chapter, for example, I needed to coordinate between laboratory resources, research groups, building facilities, animal ethics committees, suppliers, and funding sources. And that was for relatively simple in-house experiments with fish! For the academics doing research abroad, throw in permits, transport, and sometimes even political tension or natural disasters.

Working on problems no one in the world has answered yet means you need to be creative. You need to intelligently improvise when things take a turn, and persevere when your efforts end up failing. Understanding the existing literature on your topic, as well as the knowledge gap your work will fill, means mentally storing and processing a tremendous amount of information.


### Where academics struggle
The issue is that what's prioritized in academia is often actually a detriment in industry. These points of course don't apply to everyone in academia; if one of these don't relate to you, consider yourself ahead of the game. But for the rest of us, these are what I consider the biggest holes in academics' skill sets.
1. Independence != coding as part of a team. Standards, etc.
  - Yes, I get collaboration. But this is a step further. Literally editing the same code. Not necessarily different parts of the same project.
2. Broad is preferred to deep
* Speed-accuracy tradeoff. 10th-decimal place precision at the expense of timeliness.
* Not just generating knowledge (unless deep in analytics side). Can be generating a product.



Broad preferred to deep:

## A shift in perspective
Regardless of where you're aiming on the [analytics-engineering spectrum]({{  site.baseurl  }}/DS-transition-1/#the-scalpel-versus-the-shovel), it's critical to have **the right mentality**. When you're doing projects on your own, you can find that you're really good at whatever you put your mind to. That's great. But more importantly, you need to think of it this way:

 **There's a shift in how you view yourself as a coder** that's required for you to succeed in industry:

> **What you might be thinking:** <br>"I can code anything I want." <br><br>
> **What industry wants:** <br>"I can code anything someone asks me."

Especially in open-ended Ph.D. programs in the U.S., you have the flexibility to choose the research questions you pursue, as well as how you go about answering those questions. This makes it easy to gravitate towards questions and methods you're comfortable with and get _really good_ at a narrow set of skills. In a way, that's what a Ph.D. is all about: you choose a very precise question to answer, and you work until you know more about this sliver of knowledge than anyone else in the world.

You don't have the luxury of a narrow skill set when you're a data scientist, *especially* if you're at a smaller company. There's a term called ["full-stack"](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp) in software engineering - it refers to programmers who can code professionally in both the front-end and back-end environments, which require entirely different languages, perspectives, and skill sets. Data science is like being a full-stack engineer: you need to be comfortable rotating between different skill sets. It's a generalist position between data analyst and data engineer.

I found it so easy to stay in the areas of R and statistics that I already knew well. I didn't want to get out of my comfort zone, because it would require me to face the scary concept that I _don't_ actually have that wide a grasp on stats and coding. And especially with a Ph.D., there are a lot of expectations on how much you're "supposed to" know or how smart you're supposed to be. But you need to remember that the Ph.D. is a very deep, narrow knowledge set, versus the broad knowledge needed for being a versatile data scientist.

**Versatility** is key.

"10 decimal places" accuracy versus operating within constraints. Check out the [business skills]({{  site.baseurl  }}/DS-transition-5) in the [transitioning into data science series]({{  site.baseurl  }}/blog/#how-to-transition-into-data-science) for more on this.


* Getting used to speed-accuracy tradeoff
* Not just generating a recommendation, but implementing it too
* Cutting publications from the CV is painful.
