Cloud computing is an important aspect of data science work. Basically, don't be limited by the power of your computer; use powerful servers in the cloud. These servers can store your data, process things, etc.

AWS is market leader, so we'll focus on them. But all of these services are available from the other major players in the cloud market, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. This post will therefore cover more of the concepts than stuff specific to AWS.
