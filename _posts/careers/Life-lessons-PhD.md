### There are no finish lines, just checkpoints
* Need to rephrase. But basically, you don't "make it." There's a lot more work afterwards.

### Do you really know what you're talking about?
* Standing in front of the department and giving a talk, then being proven wrong. Not knowing the answer to simple questions. Need to be thorough.

### No one is looking out for you
* People aren't against you, they're just for themselves. And they often have a lot going on. Self-sufficiency. I need to be the one to take charge and make something happen. Not waiting for someone to tell me what to do and give me approval.
