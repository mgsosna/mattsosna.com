title: Learning R - 1. Introduction
---

# Beginnings
When I first encountered R in 2011, I was a junior in college. I had heard about it from other undergrads and from my TAs, and the conversations varied widely from loving R to hating it. One constant, though, was how powerful R was for data analysis and visualization. Ambitious, I tried downloading R to familiarize myself and learn its quirks.

When I opened it for the first time, though… nothing happened. I was staring at a blank white text box. Where were the buttons? How could I load any data? Why couldn’t I see my data? Everything was so much easier in Excel! I thought I could pick up R and begin learning, sort of like a musical instrument. I’d underestimated the fact that R is a _language_.

I ended up avoiding R and sticking with friendly statistical software like JMP and SPSS, where you can see your data at all times and there are buttons for mixed effects models and ANOVAs. I understood I was just buying time before I’d have to sit down with R and really learn it, but I was intimidated by feeling clueless. My time ran out a few months after graduation, though: I started collaborating with a PhD student in Germany, and the data were going to be analyzed in R. (The results of that project are [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214003881).) I read [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-An-Introduction-Biologists/dp/0199601623) and the student tutored me, and slowly I began to appreciate R. Once I learned how to teach myself, I even grew to love the language.

Now that I understand R, I’m eager to pay it forward to anyone who wants to learn. If you’re determined to learn R from me instead of [R Bloggers](http://r-bloggers.com/), [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/), or [Michael Crawley](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470973927.html), here’s a baby steps, 1 MPH introduction to R. This post is for people with little to no programming experience: I’ll explain what R is, some very simple introductory commands, and how to teach yourself. I’ll focus on the core questions I wanted answers to when I was first staring at that blinking cursor as a college student. Later posts will cover more of the basics.

**This is the first post in a series on R. This post answers:**
* What is R?
* How do I load an Excel file into R?
* How do I find answers to my questions about R?

**This post will teach you how to read this:**
```r
setwd("C:/Users/matt/Desktop")
data <- read.csv("Thesis_data.csv", header = T)
head(data)
?str
blah <- mean(c(1, 2, 4, 8))
```
_[Any code in these boxes can be copied directly into R and run. This specific example, though, will require there being a user called "matt" on your computer and a "Thesis_data" CSV file on your Desktop.]_

# What is R? Why not Excel?
<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgsosna/mgsosna.github.io/master/images/R-1-intro/rlogo-1.png"> R is a programming language. Programming lets Rlogo-1you talk more directly to your computer in a language closer to how it operates. **You tell the computer what to do.** In programs like Excel, meanwhile, some engineer at Microsoft decided the range of actions you’d want to take, so you’re limited to what he or she thought you’d want to do.

With programming, you get rid of the comfortable structure of pressing buttons and a friendly interface in favor of freedom. Your analyses are now limited by your imagination and knowledge of the R language, not what someone else thought was relevant for you. This means you can perform incredibly nuanced analyses, even those that have never been done before. **This is ideal for research.**

R has extensive built-in and downloadable statistical tools, meaning the commands for linear regression, mixed effects modeling, Fourier transforms, heat maps, bootstrapping, Bayesian stats, and more are a short Google search away. If you get stuck, there’s [a large community](http://stackoverflow.com/) of programmers regularly asking *and answering* questions about analyses in R, so you’re bound to find an answer.

One of the biggest benefits, though, is how easy it is to test ideas. Let’s say, for example, that you learned about t-tests in a stats class. The test theoretically makes sense, but you want a way to visualize what it really means when you compare two samples. **In R, you can easily create random data,** so you can create the conditions under which two samples should be significantly versus non-significantly different. You know what you’re putting in, so you can see what comes out. This will prepare you for how to look at real data later. **It’s easy to visualize data in R,** so you can look at what you’re trying to do.

```r
# Create samples by drawing from two normal distributions
sample1 <- rnorm(15, 20, 2)   # N = 15, mean = 20, sd = 2
sample2 <- rnorm(15, 20.5, 2) # N = 15, mean = 20.5, sd = 2

# Plot the two distributions
plot(density(sample1), lwd = 2, col = "deepskyblue4")
lines(density(sample2), lwd = 2, col = "firebrick2")

# Are the means significantly different?
t.test(sample1, sample2)
```

How does the p-value change if you have more data in each sample? Change the 15s to 100s in lines 2-3 above, rerun the code, and you’re done. What if the two distributions are *further apart* from each other? Change the means in lines 2-3 above, rerun the code, and you’re done. **You don’t have to trust some guy on the internet telling you what to believe;** R lets you test things yourself.

When you program, you leave behind a trail of code that leads to the result or visualization you produced. With a bit of practice, **it’s easy to share code,** meaning others can replicate your analysis. The code for the above plots, for example, is at the end of this blog post.

## Do I have to pay for R? How do I get it?
R is free. You can download it from the [R website](https://www.r-project.org/). I infinitely recommend also downloading [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/), an interface that makes R easier to use. It organizes your windows (so plots are always in the same place, for example) and highlights the syntax so it’s easier to read.

## Why is R free?
I don’t know. Maybe it’s part of that “knowledge is more important than money” mentality academics have. It might simply be because it’s more efficient to collaborate and exchange information with other researchers if everyone uses the same programming language. If you’re a researcher with a limited budget and there are two equally good programming languages, you’ll probably start using the one that’s free. At any rate, it’s very cool that R developers have made it a priority for R to be accessible to anyone who wants it.

## I took a class in college that used MATLAB, so I'll just keep using that.
Sure, go ahead. However, note that coding languages like MATLAB, Mathematica, SPSS, SAS, and Stata all require paid licenses. It’s unlikely to be a problem if you’re a grad student at a well-funded university, but don’t code yourself into a corner: many industry jobs don’t want to pay the tens of thousands of dollars for a license, so it might be a safer bet to learn a free software like R or Python. *[I actually know someone who interviewed at Facebook for a data scientist position, and they wouldn’t accept MATLAB as a coding language – only R or Python.]*

## This sounds like an advertisement for R.
I believe R made me into a much better scientist, and I’m a big fan!

## So why do you use R?
R is (currently) unparalleled in its ability to easily run complicated statistical tests and to produce beautiful data visualization. Instead of coding a non-linear least squares regression from scratch, you can download R code that’ll do it for you. Similarly, investing a little time into learning how R plots data can let you produce almost any visualization you can imagine. And as I mentioned before, R’s community is sufficiently large that websites like [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/) constantly have people asking and answering questions about how to code something in R. 99% of my solutions to R questions come from searching through this community.

However, note that R shines most strongly for statistics and data visualization. If you need to run computation-heavy evolutionary simulations, C++ is a better bet. If you want to interface with websites or robotics, you should probably go with Python.

# So I downloaded R. How do I do anything?
If you’re coming from click-based programs like Excel or SPSS, seeing a program that’s just a command line can be a bit of a shock. Think of R as a **language** and less as a program. Of course you can’t say anything in German when you start learning, or mastering all the tones in Mandarin can be frustrating (or hilarious).

Hopefully you’re in RStudio right now. In the TOP LEFT window, you can type whatever you want, and hitting enter doesn’t make R run the code. This allows you to write several lines of code before you run anything, which is essential for trickier programming. **To run a line of code in this window, press `ctrl + r` on Windows or `ctrl + ENTER` on Mac.**

The BOTTOM LEFT window is the terminal, where you can talk directly to R. When you open RStudio, there’s some text here about R and what version you have. **Typing here and then pressing `ENTER` makes R run what you wrote.** This is nice if you just want to type a quick command to check something, e.g. what `x` is equal to. For now, let’s focus on this window.

(The TOP RIGHT window is useful for having extra information about commands, like what arguments they take. For me, the BOTTOM RIGHT window displays plots.)

Below are the very first things you should do in R before you try any data analysis. This code can be copied directly into R and run.

## Numbers
```r
5
5 + 5
```
Yes, literally just type the number `5` into that box in the bottom of the screen and hit enter. Unsurprisingly, R says `5` back to you, confirming that 5 = 5 after all. Now try 5 + 5. Great work.

```r
x <- 5
x
```
The arrow `<-` is the equals sign in R. (You can use an actual equals sign if you want, but essentially everyone uses the arrow.) **By typing x and hitting `ENTER`, you’ve made a variable `x` that has the value 5. R will remember this until you tell it to forget, or you close R. Now if you ask R to tell you what `x` is, it will say 5.**

## Commands in R
Congratulations; you've just coded! If you want the formal introduction to coding, though, you're supposed to type this:
```r
print("Hello, world")
```
`print` is a command that, well, prints whatever is inside the parentheses. It’s straightforward when you’re printing literally what’s inside of the command, but we can make it more interesting like this:
```r
y <- 5
print(y)
```
`print` is nice but you probably won’t use it that often relative to other functions. A critically important function to know is the concatenate function, or `c`. This tells R that there are multiple elements to remember.
```r
z <- c(1, 2, 4, 8)
z
```
We can now run some standard analyses on that **vector** of numbers.
```r
mean(z)
median(z)
sd(z)
min(z)
max(z)
```
We could also just run it directly on the numbers if you'd prefer.
```r
mean(c(1, 2, 4, 8))
```
