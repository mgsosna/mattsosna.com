## Try things out
You only learn so well by learning the theory or watching someone else do it. There are lots of great resources for simple challenges at any skill level; check out [edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/python3) or [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python).

## Get exposed to tips
[Real Python](https://realpython.com/) is a _fantastic_ resource - I follow them on Twitter, along with [Daily Python tip](https://twitter.com/python_tip) and a few others. The idea is to pick up tips here and there. That won't create your foundational knowledge, but it'll give you the little breakthroughs for making a bit of code more efficient. There's lots of ways to carry out a task, and as you become more experienced it's about narrowing down to the paths that are most readable and efficient.

I also like the app [Enki](https://www.enki.com/), which provides little lessons and quizzes in Python, SQL, computer science, Git, and more.

## Read professional code
To that end, get exposed to professional Python. The wonderful thing about open-source code is that you can just pick it up and read it. The Python source code isn't hidden behind a paywall or carefully guarded on a secret server. It's right [here](https://github.com/python/cpython)! *[It's fairly incomprehensible unless you' have expert-level C, but it's there for the reading if you want.]*

More seriously, try to read through the code for something like the [Pandas dataframe](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/core/frame.py)
