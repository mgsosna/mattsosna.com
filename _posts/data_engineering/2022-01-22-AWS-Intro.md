Imagine you're a coordinator for data science meet & greets in New York. (Also imagine that we've sufficiently moved on from Covid that meet & greets are a thing!) A major part of your planning involves reserving a venue to accommodate your guests. You've always _rented_ venues around the city, but you wonder if it'd be better to just _buy your own_ to avoid the hassle of searching for a free one every time.

If the venue is an analogy for a computer, then the cloud computing industry would interject with a resounding **"No!"** It is far cheaper, safer, and more scalable to _rent_ computers in a data center than to buy your own, the argument for cloud computing goes. **"Let _us_ reserve a venue for you," they'd say. "In fact, forget about venues altogether, and just focus on throwing a great party."**

The concept of shared computer resources has existed [since the 1960s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#History), and the term "cloud computing" has been around [since the 1990s](https://www.technologyreview.com/2011/10/31/257406/who-coined-cloud-computing/). But it wasn't until the 2000s that the cloud computing industry started gaining momentum into the unstoppable behemoth it is today. The global cloud computing market was $445.3 billion in 2021, but it's expected to [_more than double_ to $947.3 billion](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cloud-computing-market-234.html) in just five years!

**Why is cloud computing so ubiquitous?** And **how can I utilize it as a data scientist, machine learning engineer, or software engineer?** There's a lot to unpack with these questions, more than we can fit into one post. (Even for me.) This post will therefore focus on an introduction to cloud computing: what it is and why you should care. The following two posts will then cover _storage_ and _compute_, the two central categories of cloud computing.

We'll focus on [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com), the market leader and arguably driver of the cloud revolution. But everything we'll cover is applicable to the other major players: [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [Alibaba Cloud](https://us.alibabacloud.com/en), and others. Let's get started!

## What is the cloud?
If the cloud industry had a slogan, it would be "The computer resources you need, when you need them."

The [NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)](https://www.nist.gov/) outlined five essential characteristics of [cloud computing](https://doi.org/10.6028%2FNIST.SP.800-145):
* On-demand self-service
* Broad network access
* Resource pooling
* Rapid elasticity
* Measured service

We'll go through these to explain the cloud.

### On-demand self-service


In our venue reservation example, finding the right venue is as important as finding any venue. If the venue is too small, you'll have to turn guests away. But if the venue is too big, you'll have overpaid for the event. The problem is that **it's hard to tell how many guests you'll have ahead of time.** And it's hard to be _responsive_ to the number of guests in the moment $-$ you can't easily book a larger venue and move everyone there once the party's started.

This example might sound silly, but it's a classic problem in software engineering. (At least, before the cloud came along). Imagine you're an online retailer getting ready for Black Friday. Your website is going to get a lot more traffic... so much so that the server will have trouble fulfilling HTTP requests (such as sending the HTML for the homepage when a user lands on the site, or updating the database with the availability of each item as orders are placed). You invested in a good server so it can handle normal traffic very quickly, but as the number of users ticks up to 25% higher, then 50% $-$ it starts to struggle. A request backlog forms, causing the website to slow to a crawl. Pages take minutes to load. People place orders for items that seem to be in stock but suddenly aren't. As traffic reaches [double your regular rate](https://contentsquare.com/blog/black-friday-and-cyber-monday-2021-global-mobile-traffic-increases-by-90/), your lone server fails, causing the website to go down for everyone. No website means no customers.



Main considerations:
* On-demand. Use it when you want, stop using when you stop needing it. Only pay for what you use.
    * Also: geographic independence. Access from anywhere.
* User doesn't need to actively manage the hardware. Just select the configuration you want (e.g. amount of storage and compute) and get going.
    * Avoid upfront costs of purchasing hardware
    * Avoid maintenance costs. Cloud provider should also bake in redundancy, so you shouldn't notice when servers go down.
* Economy of scale: cloud services providers can purchase thousands or millions of servers, then optimize how customers share those resources
  * This is done through virtualization - separating one device into multiple virtual devices that can be used independently. Idle resources allocated more efficiently
* Scalability. Black Friday example.

There are private and hybrid cloud options, but we'll focus on public. Private = managed for a single party.

Data science requires computers. The stronger your computer, the more computations you can run per second, the larger the datasets you can manipulate at once, and the more data you can store on your machine. This is the case for any programming work (e.g. even just having an app).

But the laptop or desktop you're using right now probably isn't optimized for running calculations all day $-$ it's optimized for providing a good consumer experience. Some resources are dedicated to the graphical interface displayed on your monitor; malware detection is running in the background; weather and news apps are pinging external APIs every few minutes to stay up-to-date.

Cloud computing is an important aspect of data science work. Basically, don't be limited by the power of your computer; use powerful servers in the cloud. These servers can store your data, process things, etc.

Scalable. You're an online retailer getting ready for Black Friday. Your website is going to get a lot more traffic... so much so that the server will have trouble fulfilling HTTP requests (such as sending the HTML for the homepage when a user lands on the site, or updating the database with the availability of each item as orders are placed). It's normally pretty fast, but as the number of users increases on your site, there'll start to be a backlog of requests, causing the website to be slow. Similarly, it can take a while for an item to be marked as out of stock... hopefully before another person adds it to their cart and orders it too!

You'd normally have to buy a bunch of servers to handle the surge in traffic your website will get.

## What is AWS?
AWS stands for Amazon Web Services. It was launched in 2002 as part of Amazon's push to have [a more service-oriented architecture](https://archive.ph/20210312233823/https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3352692) for their software engineers by maximizing the autonomy of teams, adopting REST, standardizing infrastructure, removing gatekeeping decision-makers, and continuously deploying code.

AWS currently captures about [32% of the cloud computing market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/967365/worldwide-cloud-infrastructure-services-market-share-vendor/). ([Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) follow at 20% and 9% respectively.)


## Setting up
Let's create an AWS account. These posts will make more sense if you can follow along, and you'll be able to then experiment on your own later.

We start by going the [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com) and clicking "Create an AWS Account."


## IAM (Identity and Access Management)
It might sound strange to kick off our AWS series by talking about identity management, but it's important to lock this down before we go any further. When dealing with cloud resources, you're referencing APIs that are open to the world. When an AWS server gets a request to open a file or run some code, how does it know that that request came from you and not some random intruder?

By default, no AWS service can access any other service. But an easy way to manage permissions is to have an IAM profile.
