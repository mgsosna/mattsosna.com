Imagine you're a coordinator for data science meet & greets in New York. (Also imagine that we've sufficiently moved on from Covid that meet & greets are a thing!) A major part of your planning involves reserving a _venue_ to accommodate your guests. You've always rented venues around the city to host the party, but you're wondering if it makes more sense to just buy a floor in a building somewhere so you can avoid the hassle of searching for a free venue every time.

If the venue is an analogy for a computer, then the cloud computing industry would interject with a resounding **"No!"** It is far cheaper, safer, and more scalable to _rent_ computers in a data center than to buy your own, the argument for cloud computing goes. **"Let _us_ reserve a venue for you," they'd say. "In fact, forget about venues altogether, and just focus on throwing a great party."**

The concept of shared computer resources has existed [since the 1960s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#History), and "cloud computing" as a name [since the 1990s](https://www.technologyreview.com/2011/10/31/257406/who-coined-cloud-computing/). But somehow the last fifteen years has had an explosion in interest. The global cloud computing market was $445.3 billion in 2021, but it's expected to [_more than double_ to $947.3 billion](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cloud-computing-market-234.html) in five years!

Cloud services have exploded in popularity and aren't slowing down.

But why is this the case?

Cloud services as an industry


AWS is market leader, so we'll focus on them. But all of these services are available from the other major players in the cloud market, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. This post will therefore cover more of the concepts than stuff specific to AWS.

## What is the cloud?
Main considerations:
* On-demand. Use it when you want, stop using when you stop needing it. Only pay for what you use.
    * Also: geographic independence. Access from anywhere.
* User doesn't need to actively manage the hardware. Just select the configuration you want (e.g. amount of storage and compute) and get going.
    * Avoid upfront costs of purchasing hardware
    * Avoid maintenance costs. Cloud provider should also bake in redundancy, so you shouldn't notice when servers go down.
* Economy of scale: cloud services providers can purchase thousands or millions of servers, then optimize how customers share those resources
  * This is done through virtualization - separating one device into multiple virtual devices that can be used independently. Idle resources allocated more efficiently
* Scalability. Black Friday example.

There are private and hybrid cloud options, but we'll focus on public. Private = managed for a single party.


[NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) essential characteristics of cloud computing](https://doi.org/10.6028%2FNIST.SP.800-145):
* On-demand self-service
* Broad network access
* Resource pooling
* Rapid elasticity
* Measured service


Data science requires computers. The stronger your computer, the more computations you can run per second, the larger the datasets you can manipulate at once, and the more data you can store on your machine. This is the case for any programming work (e.g. even just having an app).

But the laptop or desktop you're using right now probably isn't optimized for running calculations all day $-$ it's optimized for providing a good consumer experience. Some resources are dedicated to the graphical interface displayed on your monitor; malware detection is running in the background; weather and news apps are pinging external APIs every few minutes to stay up-to-date.

Cloud computing is an important aspect of data science work. Basically, don't be limited by the power of your computer; use powerful servers in the cloud. These servers can store your data, process things, etc.

Scalable. You're an online retailer getting ready for Black Friday. Your website is going to get a lot more traffic... so much so that the server will have trouble fulfilling HTTP requests (such as sending the HTML for the homepage when a user lands on the site, or updating the database with the availability of each item as orders are placed). It's normally pretty fast, but as the number of users increases on your site, there'll start to be a backlog of requests, causing the website to be slow. Similarly, it can take a while for an item to be marked as out of stock... hopefully before another person adds it to their cart and orders it too!

You'd normally have to buy a bunch of servers to handle the surge in traffic your website will get.




## Setting up
Let's create an AWS account. These posts will make more sense if you can follow along, and you'll be able to then experiment on your own later.

We start by going the [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com) and clicking "Create an AWS Account."


## IAM (Identity and Access Management)
It might sound strange to kick off our AWS series by talking about identity management, but it's important to lock this down before we go any further. When dealing with cloud resources, you're referencing APIs that are open to the world. When an AWS server gets a request to open a file or run some code, how does it know that that request came from you and not some random intruder?

By default, no AWS service can access any other service. But an easy way to manage permissions is to have an IAM profile.
