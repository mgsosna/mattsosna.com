Imagine you're a coordinator for data science meet & greets in New York. A major part of your planning involves _reserving a venue_ to accommodate your guests. You've always _rented_ venues around the city, but you wonder if it'd be better to just _buy your own_ to avoid the hassle of searching for a free one every time.

If the venue is an analogy for a computer, then the cloud computing industry would interject with a resounding **"No!"** It is far cheaper, safer, and more scalable to _rent_ computers in a data center than to buy your own, the argument for cloud computing goes. **"Let _us_ reserve a venue for you,"** they'd say. **"In fact, forget about venues altogether, and just focus on throwing a great party."**

The concept of shared computer resources has existed [since the 1960s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#History), and the term "cloud computing" has been around [since the 1990s](https://www.technologyreview.com/2011/10/31/257406/who-coined-cloud-computing/). But it wasn't until the 2000s that the industry began accelerating into the unstoppable behemoth of today. The global cloud computing market was an impressive $445.3 billion in 2021, for example, but it's expected to [_more than double_ to $947.3 billion](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cloud-computing-market-234.html) in just five years!

**Why is cloud computing so ubiquitous? And how can I utilize it as a data scientist, machine learning engineer, or software engineer?** There's a lot to unpack with these questions, more than we can fit into one post. This post will therefore introduce cloud computing: what it is and why you should care. The following two posts will then cover _storage_ and _compute_, the two central categories of cloud computing.

We'll focus on [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com), the market leader and arguably driver of the cloud revolution. But everything we'll cover is applicable to the other major players: [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [Alibaba Cloud](https://us.alibabacloud.com/en), and others. Let's get started!

## What is the cloud?
To cut to the chase, the cloud is just a bunch of computers sitting in a bunch of **data centers**. A _data center_ is a fancy, secure warehouse for storing a _lot_ of running computers, likely located somewhere where the electricity is cheap [or the climate is cold](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103136694875121).

These computers don't have monitors or keyboards $-$ they're just the hardware that performs calculations, stores and retrieves data, responds to [HTTP requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP), etc. We call these machines **servers** to distinguish them from the human-friendly laptops or desktops most people are familiar with, as they _serve_ responses to user requests.

The data centers of the largest tech companies $-$ Amazon, Meta, Google, etc. $-$ have _millions_ of servers stacked on top of each other in rack after rack extending [as far as you can see](https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/podcast/). Any time a person uploads a cat photo to Instagram, or bookmarks a pair of shoes on Pinterest, or responds to a message on WhatsApp, they interact with a few of these servers.<sup>[[1]](#1-what-is-the-cloud)</sup>  

## Why is the cloud useful?
You're likely already familiar with the convenience of cloud storage if you've ever used [iCloud](https://www.apple.com/icloud/), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), or [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/). You can recover your texts if you lose your phone; you can share files with links instead of massive email attachments; you can organize and search your photos by who's in them.

But the cloud is useful beyond making your personal life smoother: it can augment your professional life, too. Not all of Amazon's servers are busy handling searches for shoes, or determining which users to show ads for _Elden Ring_. Some of these servers, in fact, are available for you to rent for yourself.

**The ability to rent servers, without needing to buy and then maintain them, is the cloud's major offering.** If the cloud industry had a slogan, it would be _"Whatever resources you need, whenever you need them."_ If servers are like water droplets in a physical cloud, then the industry prides itself on users being able to mold that cloud into whatever size and shape best fits their needs.

Let's say you're launching a dating app. Users will need to upload photos, and you'll need to train [recommender systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) to rank users for each other. Simply rent a server optimized for storage to host the photos; another optimized for running the calculations for the ranking models; and maybe a small one for hosting the site, handling user authentication, etc.

Scale these three servers up to four, five, or more as your app's audience grows around Valentine's Day, and then back down to three as users' dating lives quiet down. Ditch the calculations server entirely when you decide to start matching users randomly.

Throughout this wild ride, **you only pay for what you use.** You also avoid the upfront costs of purchasing the hardware yourself, and you're off the hook if a user uploads so many photos that your storage server melts. The result is a dramatically lower barrier to accessing computational resources.

Finally, I've been saying "servers" as though you're renting the entire machine. But to make it even easier to leverage the cloud, **customers can reserve _a portion_ of a server, which _still acts like an independent machine_.** This [**virtualization**](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-a-virtual-machine) benefits both customers and cloud providers $-$ you can reserve as little compute or storage as you want, and providers can keep servers busy (and earning money) by splitting them between multiple customers.

## What is the cloud (formally)?
[**NIST** (National Institute of Standards and Technology)](https://www.nist.gov/) provides a more formal definition of the cloud by outlining [five essential characteristics](https://doi.org/10.6028%2FNIST.SP.800-145):

**1. On-demand self-service**<br>
Customers can choose the compute resources they need without requiring human interaction with the provider. *For example, a user can click a button to reserve a server to host their website, then click another button to release the server.*

**2. Broad network access**<br>
These resources are available over internal networks or the internet, and they can be accessed through multiple platforms. *For example, a user can reserve a server from their laptop, then later check on its health from their phone.*

**3. Resource pooling**<br>
Cloud resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned, with the specific location of resources abstracted away from the user. *For example, a user can reserve two servers and not need to know that one is server 123 in Data Center A in Virginia and the other is server 456 in Data Center B in New York.*

**4. Rapid elasticity**<br>

**5. Measured service**<br>

### Rapid elasticity
In our venue reservation example, finding the right venue is as important as finding any venue. If the venue is too small, you'll have to turn guests away. But if the venue is too big, you'll have overpaid for the event. The problem is that **it's hard to tell how many guests you'll have ahead of time.** And it's hard to be _responsive_ to the number of guests in the moment $-$ you can't easily book a larger venue and move everyone there once the party's started.

This example might sound silly, but it's a classic problem in software engineering. (At least, before the cloud came along). Imagine you're an online retailer getting ready for Black Friday. Your website is going to get a lot more traffic... so much so that the server will have trouble fulfilling HTTP requests (such as sending the HTML for the homepage when a user lands on the site, or updating the database with the availability of each item as orders are placed). You invested in a good server so it can handle normal traffic very quickly, but as the number of users ticks up to 25% higher, then 50% $-$ it starts to struggle. A request backlog forms, causing the website to slow to a crawl. Pages take minutes to load. People place orders for items that seem to be in stock but suddenly aren't. As traffic reaches [double your regular rate](https://contentsquare.com/blog/black-friday-and-cyber-monday-2021-global-mobile-traffic-increases-by-90/), your lone server fails, causing the website to go down for everyone. No website means no customers.

### Measured service

### Scalability



Main considerations:
* On-demand. Use it when you want, stop using when you stop needing it. Only pay for what you use.
    * Also: geographic independence. Access from anywhere.
* User doesn't need to actively manage the hardware. Just select the configuration you want (e.g. amount of storage and compute) and get going.
    * Avoid upfront costs of purchasing hardware
    * Avoid maintenance costs. Cloud provider should also bake in redundancy, so you shouldn't notice when servers go down.
* Economy of scale: cloud services providers can purchase thousands or millions of servers, then optimize how customers share those resources
  * This is done through virtualization - separating one device into multiple virtual devices that can be used independently. Idle resources allocated more efficiently
* Scalability. Black Friday example.

There are private and hybrid cloud options, but we'll focus on public. Private = managed for a single party.



Data science requires computers. The stronger your computer, the more computations you can run per second, the larger the datasets you can manipulate at once, and the more data you can store on your machine. This is the case for any programming work (e.g. even just having an app).

But the laptop or desktop you're using right now probably isn't optimized for running calculations all day $-$ it's optimized for providing a good consumer experience. Some resources are dedicated to the graphical interface displayed on your monitor; malware detection is running in the background; weather and news apps are pinging external APIs every few minutes to stay up-to-date.

Cloud computing is an important aspect of data science work. Basically, don't be limited by the power of your computer; use powerful servers in the cloud. These servers can store your data, process things, etc.

Scalable. You're an online retailer getting ready for Black Friday. Your website is going to get a lot more traffic... so much so that the server will have trouble fulfilling HTTP requests (such as sending the HTML for the homepage when a user lands on the site, or updating the database with the availability of each item as orders are placed). It's normally pretty fast, but as the number of users increases on your site, there'll start to be a backlog of requests, causing the website to be slow. Similarly, it can take a while for an item to be marked as out of stock... hopefully before another person adds it to their cart and orders it too!

You'd normally have to buy a bunch of servers to handle the surge in traffic your website will get.

## What is AWS?
AWS stands for **Amazon Web Services.** (And yes, that's the Amazon you're familiar with.) AWS was launched in 2002 as part of Amazon's push to have [a more service-oriented architecture](https://archive.ph/20210312233823/https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3352692) for their software engineers. The goal of AWS was ambitious: maximize the autonomy of teams, adopt REST, standardize infrastructure, remove gatekeeping decision-makers, and continuously deploy code. A distributed, scalable architecture was needed to do this.

AWS currently captures about [32% of the cloud computing market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/967365/worldwide-cloud-infrastructure-services-market-share-vendor/). ([Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) follow at 20% and 9% respectively.)

## Setting up
Let's create an AWS account. These posts will make more sense if you can follow along, and you'll be able to then experiment on your own later.

We start by going the [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com) and clicking "Create an AWS Account." AWS offers most of their services [free for one year](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), meaning you can learn and experiment with the real thing without needing to worry about costs. (You _do_ need to attach a credit card, though, just in case you decide to buck the gentle tutorials and start training the next Alpha Go.)


## IAM (Identity and Access Management)
It might sound strange to kick off our AWS series by talking about identity management, but it's important to lock this down before we go any further. When dealing with cloud resources, you're referencing APIs that are open to the world. When an AWS server gets a request to open a file or run some code, how does it know that that request came from you and not some random intruder?

By default, no AWS service can access any other service. But an easy way to manage permissions is to have an IAM profile.

## Footnotes
#### 1. [What is the cloud?](#whatis-the-cloud)
Technically, your HTTP request to view Justin Bieber's latest tweet likely [doesn't make it all the way](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/scaling-whatsapp-with-silky/id1370910331?i=1000467069940) to one of these massive data centers. Rather, you probably only make it to the nearest [content delivery network (CDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) node (a.k.a. point of presence, PoP), one of thousands of smaller data centers scattered all over the world.

CDNs alleviate the load on data center databases (and the internet as a whole) by [caching](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-caching/) popular content. It's much faster to retrieve data from a cache than from disk, meaning the server can immediately send back that Bieber tweet rather than needing to dig through [trillions](https://www.dsayce.com/social-media/tweets-day/) of tweets to find it. Indeed, [Netflix is able to offer such a seamless streaming experience](https://blog.apnic.net/2018/06/20/netflix-content-distribution-through-open-connect/) because they utilize massive CDNs.

But of course, there are limitations to CNDs or they'd be all we use. The hardware used for caches is expensive $-$ 1 TB in AWS is [$23 on S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/?p=pm&c=s3&z=4) and [$85 on CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/). There's also plenty of content we _can't_ store in a cache, like user data that we want locked behind a login.
