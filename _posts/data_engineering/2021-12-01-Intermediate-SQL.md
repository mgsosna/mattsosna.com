When I was learning SQL, I found it hard to progress beyond the absolute basics.

So here's something we can do. We can stay in Python and create a SQLite DB, then run queries against it. Or we can install an RDBMS like PSequel or whatever and execute queries there.

## Filters
`WHERE` is applied before aggregation steps, while `HAVING` is applied after.

{% include header-sql.html %}
```sql
SELECT
    id,
    AVG(grade)
FROM
    students
WHERE
    classroom_id = 5
GROUP BY
    id
HAVING
    AVG(grade) > 90;  
```

## `CASE WHEN`
It's common to need to perform some kind of `if`-`else` logic on a column. You could do something like this:

{% include header-sql.html %}
```sql
SELECT
    id,

```

## `WITH`
Queries can become long, especially when you're joining data from multiple tables, and you want to apply filters or aggregations to tables before joining. Sometimes you have the luxury of being able to perform part of the query in SQL and the remainder in Python, or to perform multiple queries (e.g. on temporary tables). But when you don't, you need to _nest_ queries.

Let's say we're trying to find all the names in the `cats` table that also appear in the `dogs` table. Our query will require a subquery: finding all the names in dogs.

There are two ways to get these dog names. We'll start with the method I try to avoid.

{% include header-sql.html %}
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    name
FROM
    cats
WHERE
    name IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT
            name
        FROM
            dogs
    );
```

Above, our query for
