Welcome back! In the [last post]({{  site.baseurl  }}/spamCatch-1), we covered the theory for why we use [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and machine learning for spam classification. In this post, we'll actually build such a classifier, and we'll also create a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) micro web service to make it much easier to interact with our model. In the next post, we'll connect a sleek frontend to our Flask app so you can use the model without needing to know Python.

If you want to skip ahead, you can check out the actual app [here](https://spam-catcher.herokuapp.com) and the source code [here](https://github.com/mgsosna/spamCatch). We'll keep this post simple by excluding a few extra features in the actual app, like a `set_model` method that loads an existing trained model or an `/inspect` endpoint that lets us view our model's accuracy.

## The backend
The core of our app is a Python class called [SpamCatcher](https://github.com/mgsosna/spamCatch/tree/main/static/python/spam_catcher.py) that has two main components:
1. A **TF-IDF vectorizer** that converts strings to [TF-IDF vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)
2. A **random forest classifier** that outputs the probability that a TF-IDF vector is spam

Both components must first be trained before they can output TF-IDF vectors or spam probabilities $-$ the vectorizer needs to learn the frequency of terms in the document vocabulary, and the classifier needs to learn the relationship between TF-IDF vectors and spam.

We'll therefore take an [object-oriented approach](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/object-oriented-programming) and create a `SpamCatcher` Python class, storing our vectorizer and classifier as [instance attributes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/class-instance-attributes-python/). These attributes will be referenced repeatedly in different contexts (e.g. training the model vs. generating predictions), so it'll be convenient to have them in a location any function within and outside `SpamCatcher` can easily reference.

We start with some imports and define a `SpamCatcher` class with instance attributes set to `None`.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
import logging
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer


class SpamCatcher:
    """Methods for training a ham-spam classifier"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.tfidf_vectorizer = None
        self.model = None
```

Now let's write the code that will actually update these attributes. Note that these are all [methods](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/instance-method-in-python/) of `SpamCatcher`, so they're located within `SpamCatcher` and their first parameter is always `self`.

### The TF-IDF vectorizer
Rather than coding a TF-IDF vectorizer ourselves, we'll let [Scikit-learn's TfIdfVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) do all the hard work for us. There are essentially only two steps we need to worry about: **training our vectorizer** on the sample text messages (so it learns the vector space of term frequencies across all documents), and **generating TF-IDF vectors** once the vectorizer is trained.

The method `extract_features` accomplishes the first goal for us.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
def extract_features(self,
                     labels: pd.Series,
                     docs: pd.Series) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    | Create dataframe where each row is a document and each column
    | is a term, weighted by TF-IDF (term frequency - inverse document
    | frequency). Lowercases all words, performs lemmatization,
    | and removes stopwords and punctuation.
    |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------
    | Parameters
    | ----------
    |  labels : pd.Series
    |    Ham/spam classification
    |
    |  docs : pd.Series
    |    Documents to extract features from
    |
    |
    | Returns
    | -------
    |  pd.DataFrame
    """
    if not self.tfidf_vectorizer:
        self.set_tfidf_vectorizer(docs)

    # Transform documents into TF-IDF features
    features = self.tfidf_vectorizer.transform(docs)

    # Reshape and add back ham/spam label
    feature_df = pd.DataFrame(features.todense(),
                              columns=self.tfidf_vectorizer.get_feature_names())
    feature_df.insert(0, 'label', labels)

    return feature_df
```

The first step (line 24) checks whether there's already a vectorizer at `self.tfidf_vectorizer`. If there isn't, `self.set_tfidf_vectorizer` is called. This function initializes a `TfidfVectorizer`, removes English stop words, and then trains the vectorizer on the documents.<sup>[[1]](#1-the-tf-idf-vectorizer)</sup>

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
def set_tfidf_vectorizer(self,
                         training_docs: pd.Series) -> None:
    """
    | Fit the TF-IDF vectorizer. Updates self.tfidf_vectorizer
    |
    | --------------------------------------------------------
    | Parameters
    | ----------
    |  training_docs : pd.Series
    |    An iterable of strings, one per document, to use for
    |    fitting the TF-IDF vectorizer
    |
    |
    | Returns
    | -------
    |  None
    """
    self.tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
    self.tfidf_vectorizer.fit(training_docs)
    return None
```

The next step in `extract_features` (line 28) uses `self.tfidf_vectorizer` to transform each document into a TF-IDF vector. We then turn the output into a dataframe and insert a column for the "ham" vs. "spam" labels.

### The classifier
The second core piece of `SpamCatcher` is the classifier that takes in a TF-IDF vector and outputs a probability of spam. Like the TF-IDF vectorizer, there are two main roles: 1) training our model, and 2) using it to classify messages.

We start with the aptly-titled `train_model`. This function takes in a dataframe where the first column is the spam/ham labels and the remaining columns are the elements of each document's TF-IDF vector. Setting `X` to be the second column onward (line 20) is convenient, as none of this code needs to change if we update our training set and change the number of terms in our vocabulary.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
def train_model(self,
                df: pd.DataFrame) -> None:
    """
    | Train a random forest classifier on df. Assumes first column
    | is labels and all remaining columns are features. Updates
    | self.model, self.accuracy, and self.top_features
    |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------
    | Parameters
    | ----------
    |  df : pd.DataFrame
    |    The data, where first column is labels and remaining columns
    |    are features
    |
    |
    | Returns
    | -------
    |  None
    """
    X = df.iloc[:, 1:]
    y = df.iloc[:, 0]

    # Set spam as target
    y.replace({'ham': 0, 'spam': 1}, inplace=True)

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

    rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
    rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    self.model = rf
    return None
```

In line 24 we manually specify that our target class is `spam`. (Pro tip for avoiding mysterious bugs where your model is actually predicting *the opposite* class!) And in lines 26 onward, we split our data into training and testing, fit our classifier, and then update the `model` attribute of our class.

Now let's bring the previous steps together with a `load_and_train` method. This method takes in a CSV of training data, calls `extract_features` to turn the strings into TF-IDF vectors, then feeds the processed data into `train_model`.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
def load_and_train(self,
                   data_path: str) -> None:
    """
    | Main method for class. Instantiates self.model with random forest
    | classifier trained on CSV at data_path.
    """
    raw_df = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    logging.debug("Extracting features")
    clean_df = self.extract_features(raw_df['label'], raw_df['text'])

    logging.debug("Training model")
    self.train_model(clean_df)
    logging.debug("Model training complete")

    return None
```

The final main function in `SpamCatcher` is what actually predicts whether a text message is spam. `classify_string` takes in a string text message, then converts the string to a TF-IDF vector. **It's critical that this vector has the same features our model was trained on,** so we use the same `TfIdfVectorizer` instance that was used to create our training set. This is one major advantage of object-oriented programming; we can easily refer to both this original vectorizer and our random forest classifier because they're attributes of `SpamCatcher`.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
def classify_string(self,
                    text: str) -> float:
    """
    | Get the probability that a string is spam. Transforms the
    | string into a TF-IDF vector and then returns self.model's
    | prediction on the vector.
    |
    | ---------------------------------------------------------
    | Parameters
    | ----------
    |  text : str
    |    A raw string to be classified
    """
    if not self.tfidf_vectorizer:
        raise ValueError("Cannot generate predictions; must first "
                         " set self.tfidf_vectorizer")

    vec = self.tfidf_vectorizer.transform([text])
    return self.model.predict_proba(vec)[0][1]
```

#### Classifier summary
Congrats! We've just built our machine learning spam classifier. To review, here's a schematic for what our `SpamCatcher` class looks like. (For the full code plus some extras not covered above, check out the file [here](https://github.com/mgsosna/spamCatch/blob/main/static/python/spam_catcher.py).)

```
class SpamCatcher:
    <attributes>
        - TF-IDF vectorizer
        - Random forest model

    <methods>
        - load_and_train
        - extract_features
        - set_tfidf_vectorizer
        - train_model
        - classify_string
```

At this point, we can use `SpamCatcher` to generate predictions. If you're curious, create a folder with the [training data CSV](https://github.com/mgsosna/spamCatch/blob/main/static/data/data.csv), the file that contains `SpamCatcher`, and `demo.py`, a new Python file.

```
demo_folder/
|   spam_catcher.py
|   demo.py
|   data.csv
```

In `demo.py`, we'll simply import `SpamCatcher`, train the model on `data.csv`, and then print out predictions on two strings.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
# demo.py
from spam_catcher import SpamCatcher

sc = SpamCatcher()
sc.load_and_train("data.csv")

hello_perc = round(100*sc.classify_string('Hello'))
urgent_perc = round(100*sc.classify_string('Urgent!'))

print(f"Probability 'Hello' is spam:    {hello_perc}%")
print(f"Probability 'Urgent!' is spam: {urgent_perc}%")
```

To actually run the code, open a Terminal window, navigate to `demo_folder`, and type `python demo.py`.<sup>[[2]](#2-classifier-summary)</sup> Note that it'll take a minute since the model first needs to be trained.

{% include header-bash.html %}
```bash
> python demo.py
DEBUG:root:Extracting features
DEBUG:root:Training model
DEBUG:root:Model training complete
Probability 'Hello' is spam:    0%
Probability 'Urgent!' is spam: 40%
```

Great! However, we're still pretty limited in how we can interact with our model. It'd be a lot nicer if we could generate predictions from a Python script that's not in the same folder as `spam_catcher.py`, or even use an entirely different language like JavaScript to interact with the model. In the next section, we'll use Flask to build out a web server that will grant us much more flexibility.

### Flask
Let's start by creating a directory of folders and files like this:

```bash
spamCatch
|   app.py
|   static/
|      __init__.py
|      data/
|         data.csv
|      python/
|         __init__.py
|         spam_catcher.py
```

In short, `app.py` is at the top level, with everything else inside the `static` folder. `static` and `static/python` both have [\_\_init_\_ files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448271/what-is-init-py-for), which let us load `SpamCatcher` more easily.<sup>[[3]](#3-flask)</sup> The \__init__ file in `static` looks like this:

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
from .python import *
```

And the \__init__ file in `static/python` looks like this:

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
from .spam_catcher import SpamCatcher
```

Now let's turn to `app.py`. This file will contain the central "engine" of our app, which we'll call `app`. We'll begin by loading `Flask` and `jsonify` from the `flask` library, loading and instantiating `SpamCatcher`, and creating our application.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from static import SpamCatcher

sc = SpamCatcher()
sc.load_and_train("data/data.csv")

app = Flask(__name__)
```

We then define our endpoints, or the *locations* where a user can go to to interact with some code. Our final app will have a few extra endpoints that serve user-friendly HTML pages, but for now, let's only create the endpoint that classifies a string of text sent to it.<sup>[[4]](#4-flask)</sup>

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
@app.route("/classify/<string:text>")
def classify(text):
    return jsonify(sc.classify_string(text))
```

The `@app.route` decorator contains a URL (`/classify/`) with a variable (`<text>`) that we're specifying is a string. `text` is passed into the decorated function `classify`, which sends it to the `classify_string` method of our instance of `SpamCatcher`. Finally, we need to convert the resulting float to a JSON, which we do with `jsonify`.

Finally, we add the following code to the bottom of `app.py`. This will actually turn on the server when we're ready.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
```

So all together, `app.py` looks like this:

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from static import SpamCatcher

sc = SpamCatcher()
sc.load_and_train("data/data.csv")

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/classify/<string:text>")
def classify(text):
    return jsonify(sc.classify_string(text))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
```

#### Flask summary
Congrats, we now have an app! Navigate to the `spamCatch` directory in a Terminal window, then type the following to launch our app.

{% include header-bash.html %}
```bash
python app.py
```

Launching the app means that we turn on a little engine that listens for and responds to [HTTP requests](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/http-request-methods/) at `127.0.0.1:5000`. `127.0.0.1`, also called `localhost`, is the [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) that refers to your own computer. `5000` is a [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_port_(hardware)) on your computer.

Now for the exciting bit. Open up a Jupyter notebook or Python script *anywhere on your computer*, and run this:

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:5000/classify/"
text = "Urgent! Send money: www.bank.com"

print(requests.get(url+text).json())  # 0.76
```

Tada! If you're paying attention to the Terminal window where you launched your app, you can see the following log that indicates a `GET` request was placed at your `/classify` endpoint, and that Flask successfully responded without errors (`200`).

{% include header-bash.html %}
```bash
INFO:werkzeug:127.0.0.1 - - [13/Mar/2021 21:03:41]
 "GET /classify/Urgent!%20Send%20money:%20www.bank.com HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

## Conclusions
In the [first post]({{  site.baseurl  }}/spamCatch-1) in this series, we covered the *theory* for how to build a classifier to identify spam. In this post, we then built this classifier and created a tiny Flask app to make it easy to interact with the classifier anywhere on our computer.

Because our model is accessible through Flask, we've opened up a world of possibilities for customizing how users interact with our app. In the next post, we'll design a fun frontend so users can interact with the model in a browser rather than in Python. We'll then finally get our app *off our computer* and onto the internet for others to play with. See you there!

Best,<br>
Matt

## Footnotes
#### 1. [The TF-IDF vectorizer](#the-tf-idf-vectorizer)
We're assuming the documents being passed in are our training set if `self.tfidf_vectorizer` hasn't been fulfilled. In a [production](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-write-a-production-level-code-in-data-science-5d87bd75ced) context, it'd be safer to have an explicit `train_vectorizer` function so it's harder to accidentally train the vectorizer on documents you didn't intend to.

#### 2. [Classifier summary](#classifier-summary)
The exact percentages you get will change every time you retrain the model, even on the same data, due to the randomness in which trees get which bootstrapped subsets of data. You'll also only get whole percentages for every prediction because our random forest has 100 trees, and the final prediction is the number of trees that conclude that the string is spam. We use `round` in our example to avoid potential [floating-point errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-off_error).

#### 3. [Flask](#flask)
Here's a 30-second demo of the value of \__init__ files. Imagine you have your code organized in a directory like this:

```
src/
|   __init__.py
|   classifiers/
|       __init__.py
|       spam_catcher.py
```

You're in a Python file outside this directory. Without the \__init__ files, to load `SpamCatcher` from `spam_catcher.py`, you would need to type this:

```python
from src.classifiers.spam_catcher import SpamCatcher
```

But with the \__init__ files, you can just type this:

```python
from src import SpamCatcher
```

Not only is this much more convenient, it prevents hours of headaches if you ever rearrange folders within your project $-$ any code importing classes from your project automatically redirects to the correct location.

#### 4. [Flask](#flask)
I wasn't sure whether I'd be able to get away with `GET` requests for this app. Could I really just store the text to classify in the URL itself? Would the model get confused by spaces getting converted to `%20`, for example? Fortunately, it turned out to be a total non-issue.
