Welcome back! The [last post]({{  site.baseurl  }}/spamCatch-1) covered the theory for why we'll use NLP and machine learning for spam classification. This blog post will go through how to build a spam classifier with a sleek frontend. In short, here are the steps:
1. Train a [TF-IDF](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/what-is-tf-idf/) vectorizer on a corpus of [ham and spam text messages](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset), removing stop words and performing [lemmatization](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html) to make it easier for a model to understand the content of each document
2. Train a [random forest](https://stackabuse.com/random-forest-algorithm-with-python-and-scikit-learn/) classifier to distinguish between "spam" and "ham" TF-IDF vectors
3. Build a simple [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) app with endpoints for webpages and the random forest classifier
4. Write the HTML and CSS for the user-facing pages
5. Write the JavaScript to communicate between the user-facing pages and the spam classifier
6. Deploy to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/about) so others can use your app

**Make sure to [check out the actual app](https://spam-catcher.herokuapp.com)!** (If it takes a minute to load, that's because the dyno went to sleep. The free plan only gets you so far!) You can also view the source code [here](https://github.com/mgsosna/spamCatch).

## Python
The core of the app is a Python class called [SpamCatcher](https://github.com/mgsosna/spamCatch/tree/main/static/python/spam_catcher.py) that has two main components: a **TF-IDF vectorizer** that converts strings to TF-IDF vectors, and a **random forest classifier** that outputs the probability that a TF-IDF vector is spam. Both components must first be *trained* before they can output vectors or spam probabilities.

We start by creating a Python class with a few attributes initialized to `None`. These attributes $-$ the TF-IDF vectorizer, the random forest model, and the model's accuracy and top features $-$ will be referenced repeatedly in different contexts (e.g. training the model vs. generating predictions), so it's convenient to have them in a location any function within and outside `SpamCatcher` can easily reference.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
class SpamCatcher:
    """Methods for training a ham-spam classifier"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.tfidf_vectorizer = None
        self.model = None
        self.accuracy = None
        self.top_features = None
```

Now let's write the methods that will actually update these attributes.

### The TF-IDF vectorizer
Rather than coding a TF-IDF vectorizer ourselves, we'll let Scikit-learn's `TfIdfVectorizer` do all the hard work for us. There are essentially only two steps we need to worry about: training our vectorizer on the sample text messages (so it learns the vector space of term frequencies across all documents), and generating TF-IDF vectors once the vectorizer is trained.

The method `extract_features` accomplishes the first goal for us.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
def extract_features(self,
                     labels: pd.Series,
                     docs: pd.Series) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    | Create dataframe where each row is a document and each column
    | is a term, weighted by TF-IDF (term frequency - inverse document
    | frequency). Lowercases all words, performs lemmatization,
    | and removes stopwords and punctuation.
    |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------
    | Parameters
    | ----------
    |  labels : pd.Series
    |    Ham/spam classification
    |
    |  docs : pd.Series
    |    Documents to extract features from
    |
    |
    | Returns
    | -------
    |  pd.DataFrame
    """
    if not self.tfidf_vectorizer:
        self.set_tfidf_vectorizer(docs)

    # Transform documents into TF-IDF features
    features = self.tfidf_vectorizer.transform(docs)

    # Reshape and add back ham/spam label
    feature_df = pd.DataFrame(features.todense(),
                              columns=self.tfidf_vectorizer.get_feature_names())
    feature_df.insert(0, 'label', labels)

    return feature_df
```

The first step checks whether there's already a vectorizer present in `self.tfidf_vectorizer`. If there isn't, `self.set_tfidf_vectorizer` is called. This function initializes a `TfidfVectorizer`, removes English stop words, and then trains the vectorizer on the documents.<sup>[[1]](#1-the-tf-idf-vectorizer)</sup>

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
def set_tfidf_vectorizer(self,
                         training_docs: pd.Series) -> None:
    """
    | Fit the TF-IDF vectorizer. Updates self.tfidf_vectorizer
    |
    | ---------------------------------------------------------
    | Parameters
    | ----------
    |  training_docs : pd.Series
    |    An iterable of strings, one per document, to use for
    |    fitting the TF-IDF vectorizer
    |
    |
    | Returns
    | -------
    |  None
    """
    self.tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
    self.tfidf_vectorizer.fit(training_docs)
    return None
```

The next step in `extract_features` uses `self.tfidf_vectorizer` to transform each document into a TF-IDF vector. We then turn the output into a dataframe and insert a column for the "ham" vs. "spam" labels.

### The classifier
The second core piece of our app is the classifier that takes in a TF-IDF vector and outputs a probability of spam. Like the TF-IDF vectorizer, there are two main roles: 1) training our model, and 2) using it to classify messages.

We start with the aptly-titled `train_model`. This function takes in a dataframe where the first column is the spam/ham labels and the remaining columns are the elements of each document's TF-IDF vector. Setting `X` to be the second column onward is convenient, as none of this code needs to change if we update our training set and change the number of terms in our vocabulary.

In line 24 we manually specify that our target class is `spam`. (Pro tip for avoiding mysterious bugs where your model is actually predicting *the opposite* class!)

In lines 26 onward, we split our data into training and testing, fit our classifier, and then update the `model`, `accuracy`, and `top_features` attributes of our class.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
def train_model(self,
                df: pd.DataFrame) -> None:
    """
    | Train a random forest classifier on df. Assumes first column
    | is labels and all remaining columns are features. Updates
    | self.model, self.accuracy, and self.top_features
    |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------
    | Parameters
    | ----------
    |  df : pd.DataFrame
    |    The data, where first column is labels and remaining columns
    |    are features
    |
    |
    | Returns
    | -------
    |  None
    """
    X = df.iloc[:, 1:]
    y = df.iloc[:, 0]

    # Set spam as target
    y.replace({'ham': 0, 'spam': 1}, inplace=True)

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

    rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
    rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    self.model = rf
    self.accuracy = round(accuracy_score(rf.predict(X_test), y_test), 4)
    self.top_features = self._get_top_features(list(X_train))
    return None
```

`self._get_top_features` creates a dataframe from the columns in `X_train` and the feature importances from `self.model`; it's not essential to our story so check out this footnote<sup>[[2]](#2-the-classifier)</sup> if you want more info.

To actually train our model, we use a CSV stored in the `static/data/` directory. This location is hard-coded as a [global variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_variable), `DATA_PATH`, at the top of the script (not shown here). We also use this directory to save a pickle file of our model once it's been trained. When we instantiate our class and run `set_model`, we'll load the model if it already exists, otherwise we'll train a new one.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
def set_model(self,
              save_on_new: bool = True) -> None:
    """
    | Set self.model. Uses existing model at MODEL_PATH if one exists,
    | otherwise calls self.load_and_train. Model saved to MODEL_PATH
    | if save_on_new is True.
    |
    | ---------------------------------------------------------------
    | Parameters
    | ----------
    |  save_on_new : bool
    |    If self.load_and_train invoked, whether the new model should
    |    be saved to MODEL_PATH
    |
    |
    | Returns
    | -------
    |  None
    """
    if os.path.isfile(MODEL_PATH):
        logging.debug(f"Using existing model at {MODEL_PATH}")
        with open(MODEL_PATH, "rb") as input_file:
            obj = pickle.load(input_file)
            self.tfidf_vectorizer = obj['tfidf_vectorizer']
            self.model = obj['model']
            self.accuracy = obj['accuracy']
            self.top_features = obj['top_features']

    else:
        logging.debug(f"No model at {MODEL_PATH}; training new model")
        self.load_and_train()

        if save_on_new:
            logging.debug(f"Saving new model to {MODEL_PATH}")
            with open(MODEL_PATH, "wb") as output_file:
                pickle.dump(vars(self), output_file)

    return None
```

The final "main" function of this class is one that actually predicts whether a text message is spam. Our first step is to convert the string to a TF-IDF vector. **It's critical that this vector has the same features our model was trained on,** so we use the same `TFIDFVectorizer` instance that was used to create our training set. This is one major advantage of object-oriented programming; we can easily refer to both this original vectorizer and our random forest classifier by making them attributes of `SpamCatcher`.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
def classify_string(self,
                    text: str) -> float:
    """
    | Get the probability that a string is spam. Transforms the
    | string into a TF-IDF vector and then returns self.model's
    | prediction on the vector.
    |
    | ---------------------------------------------------------
    | Parameters
    | ----------
    |  text : str
    |    A raw string to be classified
    """
    if not self.tfidf_vectorizer:
        raise ValueError("Cannot generate predictions; must first "
                         " set self.tfidf_vectorizer")

    vec = self.tfidf_vectorizer.transform([text])
    return self.model.predict_proba(vec)[0][1]
```

### Summary
Congrats! We've just built our machine learning spam classifier. To review, here's a schematic for what our `SpamCatcher` class looks like. (For the full code, check out the file [here](https://github.com/mgsosna/spamCatch/blob/main/static/python/spam_catcher.py).)

```
< imports >
< global variables >

class SpamCatcher:
    <attributes>
        - TF-IDF vectorizer
        - Random forest model
        - Model accuracy
        - Top features

    <methods>
        - set_model
        - load_and_train
        - extract_features
        - set_tfidf_vectorizer
        - train_model
        - _get_top_features
        - classify_string
```

At this point, we could load `SpamCatcher` into another Python file and actually use it to generate predictions. If we have a Python file in the same directory as `spam_catcher.py`, we could load and use our model like this:

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
from .spam_catcher import SpamCatcher

sc = SpamCatcher()
sc.set_model()
sc.classify_string("Hello")  # 0.0
```

While this works nicely for local development, we're pretty constrained in how we can use our model. In the next section, we'll use Flask to build out a web server that lets us interact with our model from other Python environments or even outside of Python.

### Flask
#### Set up
Let's build the architecture to *serve* our model's outputs. We'll accomplish this by building [a Flask app](app.py). We'll start by organizing our project like this:

```bash
spamCatch
|   app.py
|   static
|      data
|         data.csv
|         model.pkl
|      python
|         __init__.py
|         spam_catcher.py
```

Our `__init__.py` looks like this:

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
from .spam_catcher import SpamCatcher
```

Python [\_\_init_\_ files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448271/what-is-init-py-for) let us treat directories as packages. This lets us load `SpamCatcher` more easily.

#### app.py
Now let's build out `app.py`. We begin by loading the required libraries, instantiating `SpamCatcher`, and creating our application.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, jsonify
from static.python import SpamCatcher

spam_catcher = SpamCatcher()
spam_catcher.set_model(save_on_new=True)

app = Flask(__name__)
```

We then define our endpoints. We'll have two endpoints that just serve HTML pages: our main page with the classifier, and a short "About" page.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
@app.route("/")
def index():
    return render_template("index.html")


@app.route("/about")
def about():
    return render_template("about.html")
```

For fun, I included an "inspect" endpoint, where we can actually get information about our random forest classifier, which is otherwise inaccessible to us.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
@app.route("/inspect")
def inspect():
    return jsonify({'top_features': spam_catcher.top_features,
                    'accuracy': spam_catcher.accuracy})
```

Finally, the main attraction: the classifier endpoint itself. I wasn't sure whether I'd be able to get away with just storing the text to classify in the URL itself - would the model get confused by spaces getting converted to `%20`, for example? It turned out to be a non-issue. For debugging, I included a `print` statement, which updates the console when serving the app locally.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
@app.route("/classify/<string:text>")
def classify(text):
    print(spam_catcher.classify_string(text))
    return jsonify(spam_catcher.classify_string(text))
```

And of course, we need the following code to actually start our app once we type `python app.py` in the Terminal.

{% include header-python.html %}
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## The front-end
### HTML
Our HTML is stored in the `templates` directory, as Flask expects. We start with a header to load in D3.js, Bootstrap CSS, and our custom CSS files. We also include a `<style>` tag to specify a footer class.

{% include header-html.html %}
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>SpamCatch: Let's catch some spam</title>
    <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../static/css/reset.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../static/css/styles.css">
</head>
```

This simple styling gives us the black background with white text.

{% include header-html.html %}
```html
<body style="background-color: black; color: white">
```

This `<div>` is our background image. I found it easier to have a CSS class with the image as the background rather than inserting the image with `<img>` tags.

{% include header-html.html %}
```html
<div class="hero text-center"></div>
```

The CSS for this class, in [styles.css](static/css/styles.css):

{% include header-css.html %}
```css
.hero {
    position: relative;
    height: 240px;
    padding: 1px;
    margin-top: -2px;
    margin-left: -10px;
    background: black;
        background-attachment: scroll;
        background-image: url("../images/eggs.png");
        background-size: auto;
        background-size: cover;
}
```

After a header to get us pumped up, we have an input field to type in the spam message, with a placeholder to guide the user. Hitting enter (or even clicking outside the box) will trigger the JavaScript event handler (which we'll cover in a moment), but we also add a button for clarity.

{% include header-html.html %}
```html
<div class="text-center">
    <h1 style="color:white">Let's catch some spam.</h1>
<input id="text" size="100" placeholder="Type a text message here"
 style="background-color: black; color: white; border-color: black; font-size:16px">
 <button id="button" type="button" class="btn-danger" style="font-size:17px">Submit</button>
</div>
```

We then have two elements that are empty at loading but will be updated with the model output once a user submits a message.

{% include header-html.html %}
```html
<h1 id="spamProb" class="text-center spamProb"></h1>
<div id="decision" class="text-center" style="font-size: 20px"></div>
```

Finally, we have our footer with a link to the `/about` endpoint, as well as our JavaScript script that will make our page dynamic.

{% include header-html.html %}
```html
<div id="footer">
<a href="/about" style="color:orange">More info</a>
</div>

</body>

<script src="../static/js/script.js"></script>
</html>
```

### JavaScript
We start by defining strings that we'll reference or modify later. `SPAM_API` is our classifier endpoint, while the following templates are the HTML we'll use for any probability returned by the endpoint. We use our custom `String.format` function to fill the `{0}` and `{1}` placeholders with inputted arguments; it's apparently taboo to modify built-in classes in JavaScript, but I was craving something analogous to Python's convenient string templating.

{% include header-javascript.html %}
```javascript
const SPAM_API = "/classify"
var spamProbTemplate = `Spam probability: <span style="color: {0}">{1}</span><span style="color:white">%</span>`;
var decisionTemplate = `<span style="color: {0}">{1}</span>`;
```

We then have our event handlers. The first function, `onSubmit`, gets the value of the input text field, logs it to the console, and passes it to `updateSpamProb`.

{% include header-javascript.html %}
```javascript
function onSubmit() {
    var text = d3.select("#text").property("value");
    console.log(text);
    updateSpamProb(text);
}
```

`updateSpamProb` then selects the (formerly empty) div whose ID is `spamProb`. It fills the URL with the text from the input field, then uses D3 to perform a `GET` request to our `classify` Flask endpoint. Our endpoint returns a probability of spam, which we convert to a HEX color with `prob2color`. We then format our `spamProbTemplate` with the color and spam probability (converted to a rounded percentage), and assign this to the div's HTML. We then use `updateDecision` to update the `decisionTemplate` with the corresponding message and color.

{% include header-javascript.html %}
```javascript
function updateSpamProb(value) {
    var div = d3.select("#spamProb");
    var url = `${SPAM_API}/${value}`;

    d3.json(url).then(prob => {
         var color = prob2color((1-prob));
         div.html(String.format(spamProbTemplate, color, Math.round(100*prob)));
         updateDecision(prob, color);
     });
}
```

Finally, we have the event listeners, which are what actually connect these JavaScript functions to our HTML page. When the user changes the text input field or clicks the button, we'll trigger `onSubmit`, which kicks off the whole process.

{% include header-javascript.html %}
```javascript
d3.select("#text").on("change", onSubmit);
d3.select("#button").on("click", onSubmit);
```

## Deployment
We can serve our app locally with `python app.py` and then navigating to `localhost:5000` (or whichever port your app ends up using), but the next level is being able to let anyone interact with the app. For this, we turn to Heroku. I found [this StackAbuse article](https://stackabuse.com/deploying-a-flask-application-to-heroku/) incredibly helpful. To summarize briefly:

1. Create a `Procfile` that's just the line `web: gunicorn app:app --preload --workers 1`.
  - This file tells Heroku to use `gunicorn` to serve our app, which is called `app` inside `app.py`, and to preload a worker before serving the app. Preloading causes Heroku's error logs to be much more informative.
2. Create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary packages for your app to run. Make sure `Flask` and `gunicorn` are included.
3. Create a Heroku account and start a new application.
4. Link the GitHub repo for your app to your Heroku account, then manually deploy your app.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 a dozen times, puzzling over the error logs and making small changes. The final bug for me was needing to have `scikit-learn==0.21.3` in my requirements file, not `sklearn`.
6. Once you make it through, celebrate! You've deployed a web app!

## Conclusions
Ways to make it better:
* Looking for patterns in the URLs themselves. `www.google.com` is fine, but `u7x0apmw.com` isn't.
* Add features like number of letters that are capitalized, number of exclamation marks

## Footnotes
#### 1. [The TF-IDF vectorizer](#the-tf-idf-vectorizer)
We're assuming the documents being passed in are our training set if `self.tfidf_vectorizer` hasn't been fulfilled. In a production context, it'd be safer to have an explicit `train_vectorizer` function so it's harder to accidentally train the vectorizer on documents you didn't intend to.

#### 2. [The classifier](#the-classifier)
Here's the code for `_get_feature_importances`.

```python
def _get_top_features(self,
                      features: list) -> list:
    """
    | Return features sorted by importances from self.model. Number
    | limited to N_TOP_FEATURES.
    |
    | -------------------------------------------------------------
    | Parameters
    | ----------
    |  features : list
    |    List of feature names from X_train
    |
    |
    | Returns
    | -------
    |  list
    |    list of tuples in format (term, weight)
    """
    tuple_list = [*zip(features, self.model.feature_importances_.round(4))]
    sorted_list = sorted(tuple_list, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    return sorted_list[:N_TOP_FEATURES]
```

We start by zipping the `X_train` column names (`features`) with the random forest's `feature_importances_` attribute. We then sort by feature importances $-$ the second element in each tuple, hence the `key=lambda x: x[1]` argument in `sorted`. We specify `reverse=True` so the terms are sorted from most important to least. Finally, we return only the `N_TOP_FEATURES` terms to avoid returning a list of thousands of terms. `N_TOP_FEATURES` is a [global variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_variable); a coding best-practice is to make these variables all uppercase and define them at the top of the script.
