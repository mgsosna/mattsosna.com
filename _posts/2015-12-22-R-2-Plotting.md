title: Learning R - 2. Random data and plotting
header: images/datascience-hero.jpg
---
For me, coding redefines possibility. Technology now allows data analysis in ways never before possible, as well as a new avenue for human creativity. The best example of this, I believe, is data visualization. Producing effective and interesting graphs can not only tell the science better - it can draw viewers in who wouldn't otherwise read the science.

In this post, we'll use R's excellent plotting capabilities to learn about normal distributions, linear regression, and a bit more. With constant feedback from the plots in R, we'll start learning R syntax along the way.

**This is the second post in a series on R. This post covers:**
* How do I generate random data?
* How do I plot data?
* How do I run linear regression?

The first post in the series is [an introduction to R](https://mgsosna.github.io/R-1-Intro/). It covers importing data, introduction to viewing data, assigning variables, and the help function. The most important code from that post is listed here:
```r
c()             # "Concatenate," or combine. This is how you tell R to
                # expect multiple elements
x <- c(5, 10)   # x is now a two-element vector of the numbers 5 and 10
x[x > 7]        # Subset x on only the values greater than 7
```
If you're determined to start learning at this post instead of the previous one, you can download R [here](https://www.r-project.org/), and you can download RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/).

Finally, to give you a sample of the graphical possibilities in R, below are a few beautiful graphs I found online. All were produced in R. For my courteous Facebook friends supporting my blog but not terribly interested in coding: enjoy some pretty pictures!

# Random data: histograms
## Introduction
Randomness might seem like a weird place to start, but it's actually very useful for learning about distributions and plotting. Let's start with the normal - also called Gaussian
